Includes a "recommendation" and amount of years it would take to get net positive after the new closing costs.

### Stack
Built entirely in Rails just to try it as a front end and realize I would never do this again.
Run `bin/rails server` and visit localhost:3000 in browser

In the scripts dir, run refi.py with: 
`python refi.py`
